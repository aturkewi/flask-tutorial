# Python Flask Tutorial

Following along from: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/

Setup env vars with `cp .envrc{.sample,}`
  - If you are using direnv, you should be all set by allowing this file
  - If not using direnv, you will need to `source .envrc` in every terminal window and any time you update this file.
Start venv with `. venv/bin/activate`
Migrate setup the db if not already done with `flask init-db`
Start with `flask run`
